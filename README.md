# 545-Berg-Final
Final project for LIS 545 - Starbucks Union Election Results data

About the data: "Dataset of all Starbucks union elections thus far. Note that new elections are set to occur in the coming weeks/months, so this list is subject to change more so than my prior datasets. For some background, at the tail end of last year, we began to see a wave of union elections occur at various Starbucks locations. At the time of writing this, there are around 300 stores at some stage of unionization with 172 of them having unionized. Bear in mind this figure is subject to much change as there are several upcoming union elections, and new locations seem to file for elections every week."

Note on provenance: This data was collected by reporters at More Perfect Union. Their ongoing data collection efforts on Starbucks union election results can be found here: https://perfectunion.us/map-where-are-starbucks-workers-unionizing/

Note on coverage: While additional Starbucks stores have continued to hold union elections, this dataset is specific to the period 12/08/21 - 05/02/22. The original Kaggle dataset and the More Perfect Union page may be updated to reflect current election results, but this dataset will not be updated past the set coverage period.
